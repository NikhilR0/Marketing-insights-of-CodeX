## Problem statement

CodeX, a German beverage company, recently launched its energy drink in India. The marketing team aims to increase brand awareness, market share, and product development. To gather insights, a survey was conducted in 10 cities, generating responses from 10,000 respondents.
 A marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.


### Task List

Check the “Primary_Secondary_Insights.pdf” and answer the questions by analyzing the data provided. You can use any tool of your choice (Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint).
You can add more research questions and answer them in your presentation that suits your recommendations.
The target audience is the Chief Marketing Officer, you have 15 minutes to present insights to him. Make a concise presentation.
Be creative with your presentation, audio/video presentation will have more weightage.
You can use additional data based on your own research to support your recommendations
Please note that it is possible that some respondents might not have answered all the questions sincerely. For instance, a person is more likely to have not tasted the drink if they haven’t heard about it. Sense-check the data and use your judgment to clean it as required.
